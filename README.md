# language_vs
Multiple comparisons of several programming languages

Currently:
----------
- python
- java
- c++

How to use it:
--------------
Clone this repo and then open sources in your favourite editor.  
You can use split view in editors to have multiple columns and open one languge in one column

In vim you can use :vsplit for this and then :e to open.  
to move between columns just C-w and arrows (left, right)

Compatibility note:
------------------
I write this under linux currently openSUSE Tumbleweed and using:
- python 3
- gcc7 or clang4
- java 8 (openjdk)

Requesting a comparison:
------------------------
If you want to see how some code in language A is written in other languages then just open an issue or better yet make a contribution.

Making contribution:
--------------------
you can:
- make a pull request
- send me an email with your code
