# language_vs
Multiple comparisons of several programming languages

Currently:
----------
- python
- java
- c++

How to use it:
--------------
Clone this repo and then open sources in your favourite editor
You can use split view in editors to have multiple columns and open one languge in one column

In vim you can use :vsplit for this and then :e to open
to move between columns just C-w and arrows (left, right)

Compatibility note:
------------------
I write this under linux currently openSUSE Tumbleweed and using:
- python 3
- gcc7 or clang4
- java 8 (openjdk)
